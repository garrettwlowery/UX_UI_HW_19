                    <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
                    <p>User research should define the problems that the user is having with a product and determine possible solutions. Methods such as user interviews, competitor analysis, and surveys prove to be extremely helpful during this process.</p>

                    <h3>USER EMPATHY</h3>
                    <p>User empathy is important for understanding the emotions that a user might go through when using a product such as frustration due to error messages or joy when something operates smoothly. Tools such as empathy maps and user journeys are helpful in this process.</p>

                    <h3>QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</h3>
                    <p>I approach qualitative research with an ethnographic view. Methods such as participant observation as well as face-to-face interviews allow me to better understand subjective matters about the user as well as how they use the product and what challenges they might have.</p>
